    "- Every object has two things: Attributes and Behaviour.\n",
    "- Attributes are variables and behaviour is methods that are similar to functions.\n",
    "- In python, variables will be defined in a special method known as _init_ that should be present inside the class.\n",

    "- init() method in python works similarly to constructors that are present in other programming languages.\n",
    "- init() runs automatically as we do not need to call this method.\n",
    "- All methods other than init() will be executed only when they are called from somewhere in a program.\n",
    "- For every object, init() method will be get called once. So, if we create two objects then the init() method will execute two times.\n",

    "- We can pass arguments to a class in the constructor itself for their execution.\n",

    "- So, in actuality when the object is created, first we pass the object itself in an argument and then pass values of other parameters in it.\n",
    "- Whatever values you passed for different parameters in an object, will be assigned to an object through the self.\n",
    " def __init__(self, CPU, ram):\n",
    "- In a class variables are not local variables as they are associated with an object so we have to use the self with variables to fetch the values.\n",
    "- We bind data with every object so one object will have its own methods and variables."
